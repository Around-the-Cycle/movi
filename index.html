        <p>We are closing the doors to our business, Movi Family, after a beautiful and short 18 months.</p>

        <p>We launched Movi Family in February of 2023, with big dreams to create a legacy product for our family. We got the A-team right from the start: a top-tier group of product designers, engineers, and marketers. Our dream was to create a business that would not only serve our family, but countless new parents welcoming their littles ones into such a special time of life.</p>

        <p>We’re so proud of the last 18 months. We sold the Movi Cocoon to every single state in the US, we made Kourtney Kardashian’s baby registry on Poosh, and we had offers to launch in retail stores here in California. It was our desire to continue to develop the product and to serve new moms and dads at the highest level.</p>

        <p>6 months into our launch, we were sued by a top competitor, claiming that our design was too close to theirs. During our design process, and before we invested in manufacturing, we involved legal counsel to advise on intellectual property and we were given the green light to move forward with our differentiated design, specifically with this and other competitors’ designs in mind. I believe that we did our due diligence to ensure that our design was unique to the Movi story and its intended function. Our business journey has been one of integrity from the start.</p>

        <p>We believe this competitor has overstretched the boundaries of their patent to squeeze our small business out of the market. Intellectual property litigation is a big business, and litigating would require well into six figures just to defend ourselves. Assessing the costs, we were left with no choice but to ultimately agree to our competitors’ terms to stop selling and shut the business down. We fought as long and hard as we could, but ultimately the results of this case ended in a way that we were not expecting and even trying to avoid from the outset.</p>

        <p>This past year has been a doozy for our family. We’re disappointed, and there are so many other parts of the narrative that we cannot share today that explain the story. We navigated an awful legal situation for well over a year, during a high stress pregnancy, while growing a second business.</p>

        <p>We choose to forgive, to surrender, and to not become bitter. We choose not to slander this competitor. There is a depth of loss and grief to process, but we are hopeful that this will be a stripe we have earned in our entrepreneurial journey.</p>

        <p>To our fans and customers - thank you. Thank you for betting on a mom who wanted to do better for her family. Thank you for believing in us and bringing our product into our home to serve your little one.</p>

        <p>To those who worked alongside me to birth this beautiful business into being, thank you, from the bottom of my heart. It gave me so much joy to create and risk with you.</p>

        <p>For those of you who bought a Movi Cocoon, we’ll continue to offer customer support at support@movifamily.com.</p>


        <p>With love,<br>Suzy<br> Founder of Movi Family</p>
